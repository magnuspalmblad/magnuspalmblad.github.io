This is my personal blog which cover any topic of science, the history of science or research integrity that catches my interest. It is intended to hold arguments or musings too long for [Twitter/X](https://x.com/MagnusPalmblad), [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/magnuspalmblad.bsky.social) or [Mastodon](https://fediscience.org/web/@magnuspalmblad), but too short, unimportant or frivolous to be published in a scientific journal. I am creating this blog with the intention to publish at least one post per month, though the frequency will be variable. The blog also features the occasional guest blogger and links to other blogs.

The blog title refers to loose leaf paper, which at least older readers know can be collected in a binder. Whether or not I will make something from individual posts remains to be seen. The "leaves" part is also a pun on my last name, being Swedish for "palm leaves".

For those interested in the technical details, the blog is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and based on the [Reverie](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie) [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme, which itself is a fork of [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). If you already know your way around GitHub, this is an easy way to set up a blog.
