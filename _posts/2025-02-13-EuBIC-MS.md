Software developers and scientists from across Europe and beyond joined forces for a week of hacking and networking at [EuBIC-MS Developers' Meeting](https://eubic-ms.org/events/2025-developers-meeting/) in Neustift.

The EuBIC-MS Developers' Meeting, organized biennially by the [European Bioinformatics Community for Mass Spectrometry (EuBIC-MS)](https://eubic-ms.org) under the [European Proteomics Association (EuPA)](https://eupa.org/), aims to foster collaboration between computer scientists and developers in computational proteomics and bioinformatics.
The hacakthon featured brilliant keynote lectures, a poster session, and breakout sessions where participants worked together on bioinformatics tools, packages, and metadata resources to address key challenges in mass spectrometry-based proteomics. Hackathon projects were proposed by the participants themselves, with the final selection determined by vote.
For the first time, there were more projects proposed than could be accommodated, demonstrating the growing interest in the field as well as the hackathon format.
The 2025 meeting was organized February 2â€“7 at the Abbey of Neustift in Vahrn, South Tyrol, providing. By participating, attendees gained hands-on development experience, expanded their professional networks, and contributed to advancing bioinformatics solutions for the proteomics community.
