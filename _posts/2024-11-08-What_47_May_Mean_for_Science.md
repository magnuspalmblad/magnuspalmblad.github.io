The election victory for Donald Trump raises serious concerns about the role of science in policymaking and the stability of research funding. His previous administration
was marred by skepticism toward climate science, reductions in important environmental regulations, and challenges to the independence of scientific institutions.
Federal science funding could face renewed uncertainty, particularly in areas such as climate research, environmental studies, and public health.
During his first term, proposed budget cuts threatened agencies like the NIH and EPA, and similar efforts would likely re-emerge, possibly with a vengeance, undermining the standing of the US in the global community.

Climate science and environmental policy are particularly vulnerable. Trump's previous withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and rollbacks of EPA regulations demonstrated a preference
for short-term profit over long-term, sustainable economic growth. A second term will likely see further reductions in climate-related research funding, regulations, and an expansion of fossil fuel use, weakening gloabl efforts to address climate change. 

Public health and preparedness for the inevitable next pandemic could also be impacted, with the possible appointment of a vaccine skeptic to lead the HHS and threats to the personal safety of the former director of NIAID, both actions with terrible long-term prospects, severely
compromising the US' ability to respond effectively to future public health emergencies. The integrity of scientific institutions themselves is also at stake. Under Trumpâ€™s previous administration, there were instances of scientific data suppression, interference in research reporting, and
diminished independence of federal agencies. A return to such practices (again, probably with a vengeance) would erode public trust in science and weaken the credibility of government research.  

Another concern is the impact on immigration policies. The U.S. scientific enterprise depends on a global talent pool, but restrictive immigration measures and a generally hostile attitude toward immigrants will make it more difficult for international scientists
and students to contribute to US research institutions or high-tech industries. Again, it seems #47 is cocking both barrels, getting ready to shoot his country in both feet. For whatever short-term political or financial gain he thinks these ignorant policies will bring. It is difficult to find a
silver lining here, but I really hope one will eventually emerge. Until then, take care of yourselves and others, and make sure to do everything you can to change things in 2028.
