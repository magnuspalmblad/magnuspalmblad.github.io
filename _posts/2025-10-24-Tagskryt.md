Night trains have made something of a comeback in recent years. Here are a few of my experiences and comparisons between operators out of the Netherlands and Germany.

Over the last year, I have travelled by night train to and from the Netherlands with [European Sleeper](https://www.europeansleeper.eu/), [ÖBB](https://www.nightjet.com/#/home) and [SJ](https://www.sj.se/allt-om-resan/sj-nattag) (from Hamburg). I have been fortunate to afford, or have an employer who can afford, second-class sleeping accommodation with breakfast.

European Sleeper is a unique co-op startup that runs a service Brussels-Prague and Prague-Brussels three days per week, using an eclectic collection of refurbished cars built from the 1950s to the 1990s. Pros: reasonable price, super friendly staff. When travelling with two people, there is no problem fitting suitcases on or under the bed if you're two people s, at least not in the 5-berth comfort couchette. Cons: sleeping cars not always working (once I was downgraded to a couchette, still private and with breakfast, but considerably less comfortable). Reimbursement was generous and effortless. Arrival time in Berlin is also too early (shortly after 6 am), however, very comfortable for Dresden or Prague (just in time for lunch).

ÖBB, the Austrial Railways, is the clear market leader when it comes to night trains. Pros: Even though was in one of the older sleeping cars, it was very comfortable, and would even have had space in the corner for one suitcase. Longer table for two people to enjoy breakfast, but otherwise in the way (the layout has been improved in the new generation of Nightjets, however). Staff was friendly and professional, both on the train and i the lounge. Having a choice of breakfast items _and_ having it delivered at a time or your choosing to your cabin is a nice touch. Also a goodie bag with a small bottle of sparkling wine, some snacks, ear plugs, eye mask and slippers.

SJ, the Swedish Railways, which sadly will stop operating the night train between Stockholm and Berlin after next summer, still has a sold offering in their sleeping cars. Pros: good bedding, towels, friendly staff, quiet ride. Best breakfast in terms of quality and freshness, though one may have to walk throughout the entire train to get it. Comfortable arrival time in Stockholm, and everything after Alvesta is OK. Cons: _very_ tight space - especially if you are two. No room for a suitcase if you are two. water pressure in cabin sink was abysmal. But the shared bathrooms were better, and kept clean. No goodie bag, but a couple of small sweets and water.
