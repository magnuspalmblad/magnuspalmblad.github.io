Night trains have made something of a comeback in recent years. Here are a few of my experiences and comparisons between operators out of the Netherlands and Germany.

Over the last year, I have travelled by night train to and from the Netherlands with [European Sleeper](https://www.europeansleeper.eu/), [ÖBB](https://www.nightjet.com/#/home) and [SJ](https://www.sj.se/allt-om-resan/sj-nattag) (from Hamburg). I have been fortunate to afford, or have an employer who can afford, second-class sleeping accommodation with breakfast.

European Sleeper is a unique co-op startup that runs a service Brussels-Prague and Prague-Brussels three days per week, using an eclectic collection of refurbished cars built from the 1950s to the 1990s. Pros: reasonable price, super friendly staff. Cons: sleeping cars not always working (once I was downgraded to a couchette, still private and with breakfast, but considerably less comfortable).
