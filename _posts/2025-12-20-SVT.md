To give a very brief background Per-Albin Hansson served as Prime Minister of Sweden from 1932 to 1946, with the exception of a brief period in 1936. He is most remember for leading Sweden through the Second World War, and for the Swedish “folkhem” (people’s home). Per Albin lived at Ålstensgatan 40 (below) in Bromma, in one of 94 terraced houses designed by architect Paul Hedqvist and built in the 1930s. They have become a symbol of the folkhem and are today colloquially referred to as the Per-Albin houses. Today, the houses are listed as protected buildings.

In 2025, Swedish Television aired a TV series about how Sweden was built, with great emphasis on the folkhem, social democracy, and cooperatives. When discussing the Per-Albin houses, SVT show a row how identical houses (below).
